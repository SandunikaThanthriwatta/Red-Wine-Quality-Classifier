> Predicting red wine quality as **Good** or **Bad** using **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine** classifiers, with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.

## 📖 About the Project

This project classifies red wine samples as either **Good** (quality > 6.5) or **Bad** (quality ≤ 6.5) based on 11 physicochemical features. Two ML models are compared and evaluated.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** UCI Red Wine Quality — [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

- 1,599 red wine samples
- 11 physicochemical features
- Binary target: Good (1) vs Bad (0)

**Quality Distribution:** 5→681, 6→638, 7→199, 4→53, 8→18, 3→10

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key feature trends observed vs wine quality:

| Feature | Trend |
|---|---|
| Volatile Acidity | ⬇️ Downward — lower = better quality |
| Alcohol | ⬆️ Upward — higher = better quality |
| Sulphates | ⬆️ Upward — more = better quality |
| Citric Acid | ⬆️ Upward — more = better quality |

> All EDA plots are available in the [original notebook](Red_Wine_Quality_RF_and_SVC.ipynb).

## 🤖 Models & Results

Data split: **80% train / 20% test** | Scaling: `StandardScaler`

### Accuracy Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 🌲 Random Forest | **88.13%** | n_estimators=100 |
| 🔷 SVC (Default) | **87.50%** | Default RBF kernel |
| ✅ SVC (Tuned) | **89.69%** | C=1.2, gamma=0.9, kernel=rbf |

🏆 **Best Model:** Tuned SVC — **89.69% accuracy**

RF Cross-Validation (10-fold) Mean: **91.17%**

### Confusion Matrix — Random Forest

```
Predicted →     0      1
Actual 0:      263     10
Actual 1:       28     19
```
Correct: 282 / 320 | Accuracy: **88.13%**

### Confusion Matrix — Tuned SVC

```
Predicted →     0      1
Actual 0:      271      2
Actual 1:       31     16
```
Correct: 287 / 320 | Accuracy: **89.69%**
